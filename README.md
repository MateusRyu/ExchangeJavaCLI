## Goal

The main goal of this project is to consolidate the knowledge gained in the back-end Java specialist training proposed by 
Alura and Oracle. This is a Java CLI application that allows users to exchange values between different currencies based 
on exchange rates provided by some external API. The main skills tested in this challenge were:

- Making requests to an external API (specifically, an exchange rate API);
- Parse JSON responses to a Java object;
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP);
- Handle errors and exception.

## Features

- [X] **Currency Conversion**: The application allows conversion of values between different currencies based on exchange 
rates provided by the API;
- [ ] **Conversion History**: At the end of a session, the application generates a .json file with the conversion results 
for the user to access later;
- [X] **Support for Additional Currencies**: Users are not limited to initial options. They can input the code of any 
currency, beyond the pre-suggested options, for conversion.

## Technologies

- **Java**: Programming language used for this challenge;
- **Gson**: Library for converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa;
- **Exchange Rate API**: This API provides real-time exchange rate data. More information can be found at Exchange Rate API.
